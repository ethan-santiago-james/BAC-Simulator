# BAC-Simulator
A program that uses recurrence equations, and modeling techniques to run a live simulation of BAC measurements while drinking alcohol.

## How to use
You will be asked to fill out a questionnaire that has questions related to a past night of drinking.

## Reason for creation
A potential use of this program would be to gain an estimate of what your BAC would be if 
you had a certain number of drinks, over a certain amount of time with a certain alcohol percentage.
Of course, no models are correct only useful.
