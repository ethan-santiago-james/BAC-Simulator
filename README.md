# BAC-Simulator
### A program that uses recurrence equations, and modeling techniques to run a live simulation of BAC measurements while drinking alcohol all with the goal of individuals being able to discover a drinking amount, and frequency that is safe for them. Parameters were retrieved from a COMO101 (Modelling and Computation university paper) lecture slide.

# How to use
### Run BACSimulator.java to begin use
### You will be asked to fill out a questionnaire that has questions related to your weight, how much you plan on drinking, and how much you plan on eating before drinking to make the simulation as accurate as possible

# Reason for creation
### A potential use of this program would be to gain an estimate of what your BAC would be if you had a certain number of drinks, over a certain amount of time with a certain alcohol percentage. Of course, no models are every fully correct, and are instead only useful as an approximation.
