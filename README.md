# BAC-Simulator
### A program that uses recurrence equations, and modeling techniques to run a live simulation of BAC measurements while drinking alcohol all with the goal of individuals being able to discover a drinking amount, and frequency that is safe for them. Code for the project is in the master branch.

# How to use
### Run BACSimulator.java to begin use
### You will be asked to fill out a questionnaire that has questions related to a past night of drinking.

# Reason for creation
### A potential use of this program would be to gain an estimate of what your BAC would be if you had a certain number of drinks, over a certain amount of time with a certain alcohol percentage. Of course, no models are correct only useful.
